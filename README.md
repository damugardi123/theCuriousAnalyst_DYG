ðŸ’¡Exploring Data, One Insight At A Time..!
Hi, Welcome to The Curious Analyst! If youâ€™re someone whoâ€™s exploring the world of data analytics or just curious about how data can tell stories, youâ€™re in the right place. I started this blog to document my learning journeyâ€”sharing insights, challenges, and everything in between. This is my space to grow, and I hope it helps you in some way too!

Why I Started This Project..!
Like many aspiring data analysts, Iâ€™ve spent hours learning SQL, Power BI, and Pythonâ€”sometimes making great progress, other times feeling completely stuck. I wanted a space to document my journey, share insights, and create a portfolio that showcases my work to recruiters.

What Youâ€™ll Find Here..?

This blog will be a mix of:
âœ… Personal learnings â€“ Things I pick up while exploring analytics.
âœ… Mini projects & dashboards â€“ Showcasing my skills and experiments.
âœ… Industry insights â€“ Trends and updates in data analytics.
âœ… Career reflections â€“ My job search journey, wins, and lessons learned.
